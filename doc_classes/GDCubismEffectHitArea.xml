		By placing it as a child element of [GDCubismUserModel], you can handle the _HitArea_ set on the Live2D model.
		_HitArea_ is composed of any _Triangle_. This allows you to express complex shapes, but in the _GDCubismEffectHitArea_ class, it is treated as a box (_Rect2_) that contains the vertices that make up the _Triagle_.
		If you want to determine on a _Triangle_ basis, you can do so by using the _get_detail_ function after receiving the _hit_area_entered_ signal.

				You can get more detailed information at the time of _hit_area_entered_. +
				The information obtained has three types of states depending on the judgment result between the point specified by _set_target_ and the _mesh_ specified by _id_.

				Gets the point specified by _set_target_.

			<param index="0" name="target" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				You can perform contact detection with HitArea and the specified coordinates. +
				Calling _set_target_ once is considered a click. +
				Calling it continuously is considered a drag operation.

				Called when the _HitArea_ of the Live2D model is set at the point specified by _set_target_. +
				The behavior changes as follows depending on the state of _monitoring_.
				- [b]In case of [code]true[/code]:[/b] ... It will not be called until _set_target_ is removed from _HitArea_ after it is called.
				- In case of _false_ ... It will be called any number of times while _set_target_ is within _HitArea_.

		<signal name="hit_area_exited">

			<param index="1" name="id" type="String" />
			<description>
				Called when _set_target_ becomes outside the range of _HitArea_ after _hit_area_enterd_ is called. +
				This signal has a chance to be called after [method GDCubismEffectHitArea.hit_area_enterd] is called, regardless of the state of _minitoring_, and it is only called once.
