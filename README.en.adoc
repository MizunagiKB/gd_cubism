== About GDCubism

This software (GDCubism) is an **unofficial** GDExtension that makes the link:https://www.live2d.com/download/cubism-sdk/[Live2D Cubism SDK] accessible from GDScript or C#.

[NOTE]
====
This GDExtension is available for use with Godot Engine 4.3 and above. (If you wish to use it with versions 4.1 or 4.2, please use link:https://github.com/MizunagiKB/gd_cubism/releases/tag/v0.8.2-godot4.1[v0.8.2-godot4.1])
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting from version 0.9, the rendering method has been switched to direct rendering, significantly reducing the processing load on the Godot Engine and GPU memory consumption.

However, this change has introduced several modifications. The most notable change is that _GDCubismUserModel_ is no longer a _SubViewport_.

If you wish to handle it in the same manner as before, place the _GDCubismUserModel_ under a _SubViewport_. (As a demonstration of this change, the demo file `demo_fade.tscn` has been added.)
====

Internally, GDCubism uses the link:https://github.com/Live2D/CubismNativeFramework[Cubism Native Framework] published by Live2D Inc.

Please do not contact the developer, Live2D Inc., regarding GDCubism.
