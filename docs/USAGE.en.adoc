== How to use

If you want to get started right away, please open _project.godot_ located in the _demo_ folder from the Godot Engine editor. (Instructions on how to run the demo are provided below in this document)

If you want to use it in your own project, please copy the contents of the _addons_ folder located in the _demo_ folder to the project you wish to use.

If an _addons_ folder already exists, please copy the contents of the _gd_cubism_ folder.

NOTE: The _addons_ folder is a designated folder for storing programs that extend the Godot Engine, such as GDCubism.


=== Easy to use (from Editor)

=== Troubleshooting

* Model does not load properly

If the model file name is in Japanese, it will not load properly, so overwriting the file name output by the Cubism Editor and the reference in *.model3.json will work properly.

* Blink does not occur normally

It is possible that the Ids for EyeBlink in *.model3.json is not specified. Please set it and re-export, or add ParamEyeLOpen and ParamEyeROpen to Ids.


== About the Demo

The _demo_ folder contains the following items as samples. To run any of the samples, you will need the Live2D model of Nijiiro Mao.

This Live2D model can be downloaded from link:https://www.live2d.com[].

Please arrange the contents of the downloaded file as follows:

* (_demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d_)
** mao_pro_jp
*** runtime
**** expressions
***** ...
**** map_pro_t02.4096
***** ...
**** motions
***** ...
**** mao_pro_t02.cdi3.json
**** mao_pro_t02.moc3
**** mao_pro_t02.model3.json
**** mao_pro_t02.physics3.json
**** mao_pro_t02.pose3.json
*** mao_pro_t02.can3
*** mao_pro_t02.cmo3

If you want to try with your own model, please place the output referring to the above in _demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d_.
