This bug occurs when using the Vulkan renderer in Forward+, mobile, and although some issues have been addressed, it has not been resolved in the macOS environment. To address this issue, we have made it possible to specify COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030 during scons execution. COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030=1 (default) Does not call the rendering process of the Live2D model when the Window is in non-display state. COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030=0 Calls the rendering process of the Live2D model regardless of the display state of the Window. For details on the bug, please refer to the following issues: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/89651 https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/90017 https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/90030 GDCubism, which internally uses CubismNativeFramework, is designed to be able to play Live2D models created with Cubism Editor. However, differences may arise in drawing priority and motion. The Cubism SDK for Native’s documentation contains differences in operation with Cubism Editor and tips for data creation. The content of the document is mainly for Unity and Cubism SDK for Native, and there are places where it cannot be used as is, but please refer to it.

The elements of array are Dictionary, and have elements id and name. id points to mesh element, so it can be used as a key for get_meshes. + You can implement interaction with Live2D model using this function and information obtained from get_meshes. If you don’t need advanced processing, you can easily use it by using GDCubismEffectHitArea class. Dictionary get_meshes() Gets information about ArrayMesh of MeshInstance used in current Motion state. The keys this Dictionary holds are identical to names of MeshInstance generated by GDCubismUserModel. The information that can be obtained is internal ArrayMesh. It can be used in following way. var dict_mesh: Dictionary = model.get_meshes() var ary_mesh: ArrayMesh = dict_mesh[art_mesh_name] var ary_surface: Array = ary_mesh.surface_get_arrays(0) var mesh_vertex: PackedVector2Array = ary_surface[ArrayMesh.ARRAY_VERTEX] var mesh_tex_uv: PackedVector2Array = ary_surface[ArrayMesh.ARRAY_TEX_UV] var mesh_index: PackedInt32Array = ary_surface[ArrayMesh.ARRAY_INDEX] get_meshes is an experimental function added in v0.1. Please note that the specification may change or be deleted in the future. Dictionary get_motions() Returns a list of Motions from the currently held Live2D model. The returned Dictionary is group and the number of motions contained in it. To enumerate all motions, write as follows. var dict_motion = $GDCubismUserModel.get_motions() for group in dict_motion.keys(): for no in dict_motion[group]: print(\"group: %s, no: %d\" % [group, no]) Array get_parameter() Gets a class to operate the currently held Live2D model. Array get_part_opacity() Gets a class to operate the part transparency of the currently held Live2D model. void start_expression(expression_id: String) Plays the specified expression_id. GDCubismMotionQueueEntryHandle start_motion(group: String, no: int, priority: Priority) Plays the Motion specified by group and no. GDCubismMotionQueueEntryHandle start_motion_loop(group: String, no: int, priority: Priority) Plays the Motion specified by group and no. Specify this when you want to play repeatedly. If the loop argument is false, it behaves the same as the start_motion function. void stop_expression() Stops the currently playing Expression. void stop_motion() Stops the currently playing Motion.","title":"GDCubismUserModel","component":"gd_cubism","version":"0.6","name":"gd_cubism_user_model","url":"/gd_cubism/0.6/en/api/gd_cubism_user_model.html","titles":[{"text":"Desc","hash":"_desc","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Methods","hash":"_methods","id":3},{"text":"Signals","hash":"_signals","id":4},{"text":"Enumerations","hash":"_enumerations","id":5},{"text":"Property

高度な処理を必要としない場合は、 GDCubismEffectHitArea クラスを使用する事で、簡単に利用する事が可能です。 Dictionary get_meshes() 現在の Motion 状態で使用されている MeshInstance の ArrayMesh 情報を取得します。 この Dictionary が持つキーは GDCubismUserModel が生成する MeshInstance の名前と同一です。取得できる情報は内部で使用されている ArrayMesh です。 以下の様な形で使用することができます。 var dict_mesh: Dictionary = model.get_meshes() var ary_mesh: ArrayMesh = dict_mesh[art_mesh_name] var ary_surface: Array =

PackedInt32Array = ary_surface[ArrayMesh.ARRAY_INDEX] get_meshes は v0.1 で追加された実験的な関数です。今後仕様が変更されたり削除される可能性がある事に注意してください。 Dictionary get_motions() 現在保持しているLive2Dモデルから Motion 一覧を戻します。 戻される Dictionary は group とその中に含まれるモーション数です。 全てのモーションを列挙する場合は、以下の様に記述します。 var dict_motion = $GDCubismUserModel.get_motions() for group in dict_motion.keys(): for no in dict_motion[group]: print(\"group: %s, no: %d\" % [group, no]) Array get_parameter() 現在保持しているLive2Dモデルを操作するためのクラスを取得します。 Array get_part_opacity() 現在保持しているLive2Dモデルのパーツ透明度を操作するためのクラスを取得します。 void start_expression(expression_id: String) 指定した

If an addons folder already exists, please copy the contents of the gd_cubism folder. The addons folder is a designated folder for storing programs that extend the Godot Engine, such as GDCubism. Describes how to import a Live2D model and view it in Sprite2D. Please arrange the nodes in the same way while referring to the figure below. Select GDCubismUserModel from the node list and press the file selection button to the right of the Assets item. A file selection dialog will appear, from which you can select any *.model3.json file. Once the Live2D model is loaded correctly, the preview screen displays the Live2D model. Then select the Sprite2D node to open the Texture item. When you select ''New ViewportTexture'' from the list, a dialog to select Viewport will appear, select GDCubismUserModel. The Live2D model is displayed in the Texture field. The Live2D model is also displayed at the Sprite2D position. If the model file name is in Japanese, it will not load properly, so overwriting the file name output by the Cubism Editor and the reference in *.model3.json will work properly. It is possible that the Ids for EyeBlink in *.model3.json is not specified. Please set it and re-export, or add ParamEyeLOpen and ParamEyeROpen to Ids. Mipmap has been enabled for shaders from version 0.5 onwards. If you wish to enable it, please re-import the texture being used in Live2D with Mipmap enabled. The effect of Mipmap is quite significant, however, depending on the image, it may appear blurry. Without Mipmap Application With Mipmap Application Live2D models utilize various files, which are internally processed by Live2D. Consequently, Godot Engine struggles to effectively package Live2D-related resources. To ensure proper packaging, navigate to the Resources section in the Export screen. Here, directly specify the resources you are using and the folder containing these resources. For detailed instructions, refer to the Resource options section in the official documentation on Exporting projects: https://docs.godotengine.org/ja/4.x/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html#resource-options The demo folder contains the following items as samples. To run any of the samples, you will need the Live2D model of Nijiiro Mao. This Live2D model can be downloaded from https://www.live2d.com. Please arrange the contents of the downloaded file as follows: (demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d) mao_pro_jp runtime expressions …​ map_pro_t02.4096 …​ motions …​ mao_pro_t02.cdi3.json mao_pro_t02.moc3 mao_pro_t02.model3.json mao_pro_t02.physics3.json mao_pro_t02.pose3.json mao_pro_t02.can3 mao_pro_t02.cmo3 If you want to try with your own model, please place the output referring to the above in demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d.
