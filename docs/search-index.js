If you want to try out any feature extensions or bug fixes, please switch branches as appropriate. git clone https://github.com/MizunagiKB/gd_cubism.git cd gd_cubism git submodule update --init Next, please obtain the SDK necessary for building from the Live2D official website. Live2D Official website - https://www.live2d.com/ Cubism SDK for Native includes the Cubism Native Framework in addition to the Cusism SDK.

This bug occurs when using the Vulkan renderer in Forward+, mobile, and although some issues have been addressed, it has not been resolved in the macOS environment. To address this issue, we have made it possible to specify COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030 during scons execution. COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030=1 (default) Does not call the rendering process of the Live2D model when the Window is in non-display state. COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030=0 Calls the rendering process of the Live2D model regardless of the display state of the Window. For details on the bug, please refer to the following issues: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/89651 https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/90017 https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/90030 GDCubism, which internally uses CubismNativeFramework, is designed to be able to play Live2D models created with Cubism Editor. However, differences may arise in drawing priority and motion. The Cubism SDK for Native’s documentation contains differences in operation with Cubism Editor and tips for data creation. The content of the document is mainly for Unity and Cubism SDK for Native, and there are places where it cannot be used as is, but please refer to it.

If you want to use the latest Framework or customize it for your own needs, you can do so by following these steps: pushd thirdparty git clone https://github.com/Live2D/CubismNativeFramework.git popd This build has priority over the Framework in CubismSdkForNative, so please delete it when it is no longer needed. The following items are required for building: VisualStudio Community, version 2019 or lator. Python 3.8+ SCons 3.0+ build system. Installing Visual Studio caveats If installing Visual Studio, make sure to enable C++ in the list of workflows to install. If you’ve already made the mistake of installing Visual Studio without C++ support, run the installer again; it should present you a Modify button. Running the installer from Add/Remove Programs will only give you a Repair option, which won’t let you install C++ tools.

If an addons folder already exists, please copy the contents of the gd_cubism folder. The addons folder is a designated folder for storing programs that extend the Godot Engine, such as GDCubism. Describes how to import a Live2D model and view it in Sprite2D. Please arrange the nodes in the same way while referring to the figure below. Select GDCubismUserModel from the node list and press the file selection button to the right of the Assets item. A file selection dialog will appear, from which you can select any *.model3.json file. Once the Live2D model is loaded correctly, the preview screen displays the Live2D model. Then select the Sprite2D node to open the Texture item. When you select ''New ViewportTexture'' from the list, a dialog to select Viewport will appear, select GDCubismUserModel. The Live2D model is displayed in the Texture field. The Live2D model is also displayed at the Sprite2D position. If the model file name is in Japanese, it will not load properly, so overwriting the file name output by the Cubism Editor and the reference in *.model3.json will work properly. It is possible that the Ids for EyeBlink in *.model3.json is not specified. Please set it and re-export, or add ParamEyeLOpen and ParamEyeROpen to Ids. Mipmap has been enabled for shaders from version 0.5 onwards. If you wish to enable it, please re-import the texture being used in Live2D with Mipmap enabled. The effect of Mipmap is quite significant, however, depending on the image, it may appear blurry. Without Mipmap Application With Mipmap Application Live2D models utilize various files, which are internally processed by Live2D. Consequently, Godot Engine struggles to effectively package Live2D-related resources. To ensure proper packaging, navigate to the Resources section in the Export screen. Here, directly specify the resources you are using and the folder containing these resources. For detailed instructions, refer to the Resource options section in the official documentation on Exporting projects: https://docs.godotengine.org/ja/4.x/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html#resource-options The demo folder contains the following items as samples. To run any of the samples, you will need the Live2D model of Nijiiro Mao. This Live2D model can be downloaded from https://www.live2d.com. Please arrange the contents of the downloaded file as follows: (demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d) mao_pro_jp runtime expressions …​ map_pro_t02.4096 …​ motions …​ mao_pro_t02.cdi3.json mao_pro_t02.moc3 mao_pro_t02.model3.json mao_pro_t02.physics3.json mao_pro_t02.pose3.json mao_pro_t02.can3 mao_pro_t02.cmo3 If you want to try with your own model, please place the output referring to the above in demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d. Name Desc demo_effect_custom_01.tscn This is a sample using GDCubismEffectCustom. demo_effect_custom_02.tscn This is a sample using GDCubismEffectCustom. It performs a simple lip sync, moving the mouth according to the volume. demo_effect_custom_03.tscn This is a sample using GDCubismEffectTargetPoint. The Live2D model will look in the direction of the mouse position. demo_effect_hit_area.tscn This is a sample using GDCubismEffectHitArea. It also serves as a usage sample for the HitArea set in the Live2D model. demo_simple.tscn This is a sample that displays the Live2D model only with a combination of Nodes. demo_transparent.tscn This is a sample that displays only the character by making the surroundings of the Live2D model transparent. viewer.tscn This is a sample that also serves as a simple viewer. You can play Expression and Motion. The program is available in both GDScript and C# versions. You can check the operation by replacing the script assigned to the tscn file.

Please note that the specification may change or be deleted in the future. Dictionary get_motions() Returns a list of Motions from the currently held Live2D model. The returned Dictionary is group and the number of motions contained in it. To enumerate all motions, write as follows. var dict_motion = $GDCubismUserModel.get_motions() for group in dict_motion.keys(): for no in dict_motion[group]: print(\"group: %s, no: %d\" % [group, no]) Array get_parameter() Gets a class to operate the currently held Live2D model.

GDCubismMotionQueueEntryHandle start_motion_loop(group: String, no: int, priority: Priority) Plays the Motion specified by group and no. Specify this when you want to play repeatedly. If the loop argument is false, it behaves the same as the start_motion function. void stop_expression() Stops the currently playing Expression. void stop_motion() Stops the currently playing Motion.","title":"GDCubismUserModel","component":"gd_cubism","version":"0.6","name":"gd_cubism_user_model","url":"/gd_cubism/0.6/en/api/gd_cubism_user_model.html","titles":[{"text":"Desc","hash":"_desc","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Methods","hash":"_methods","id":3},{"text":"Signals","hash":"_signals","id":4},{"text":"Enumerations","hash":"_enumerations","id":5},{"text":"Property
