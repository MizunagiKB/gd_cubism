This bug occurs when using the Vulkan renderer in Forward+, mobile, and although some issues have been addressed, it has not been resolved in the macOS environment. To address this issue, we have made it possible to specify COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030 during scons execution. COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030=1 (default) Does not call the rendering process of the Live2D model when the Window is in non-display state.

Select GDCubismUserModel from the node list and press the file selection button to the right of the Assets item. A file selection dialog will appear, from which you can select any *.model3.json file.

Vector2 adjust_position [default: Vector2(0, 0)] Changes the rendering position of the Live2D model. GDCubism performs the rendering of the Live2D model within its own SubViewport. By adjusting this parameter, you can close-up a part of the Live2D model or use it when the auto_scale rendered result is not drawn well. float adjust_scale [default: 1.0] Changes the rendering size of the Live2D model. GDCubism performs the rendering of the Live2D model within its own SubViewport. By adjusting this parameter, you can freely change the rendering size of the Live2D model. String assets [default: \"\"] By specifying a file with the *.model3.json extension, you can load the Live2D model. As soon as you specify a file, it will be loaded immediately. Since the clear function is called internally, if you want to switch the Live2D model, you can do so by simply specifying a new file. bool auto_scale [default: true] GDCubismUserModel tries to render the Live2D model to fit within the SubViewport size specified for itself. Therefore, there may be results that the creator of the Live2D model did not intend. By unchecking this, you can display without scaling. bool load_expressions [default: true] If set to false, it will not load Expressions when loading the Live2D Model. bool load_motions [default: true] If set to false, it will not load Motions when loading the Live2D Model. ParameterMode parameter_mode [default: 0] Specifies the control method for the currently held Live2D model. MotionProcessCallback playback_process_mode [default: 1] Specifies the playback method for the currently held Live2D model. Shader shader_add Specifies the shader used to render the Live2D model.

Array get_cubism_motion_queue_entries() Returns information about the currently playing Motion. Array get_expressions() Returns a list of Expressions from the currently held Live2D model. The information obtained can be used as an argument for the start_expression function. Array get_hit_areas() Gets information about HitArea set in Live2D model. The elements of array are Dictionary, and have elements id and name. id points to mesh element, so it can be used as a key for get_meshes. + You can implement interaction with Live2D model using this function and information obtained from get_meshes. If you don’t need advanced processing, you can easily use it by using GDCubismEffectHitArea class. Dictionary get_meshes() Gets information about ArrayMesh of MeshInstance used in current Motion state. The keys this Dictionary holds are identical to names of MeshInstance generated by GDCubismUserModel. The information that can be obtained is internal ArrayMesh. It can be used in following way. var dict_mesh: Dictionary = model.get_meshes() var ary_mesh: ArrayMesh = dict_mesh[art_mesh_name] var ary_surface: Array = ary_mesh.surface_get_arrays(0) var mesh_vertex: PackedVector2Array = ary_surface[ArrayMesh.ARRAY_VERTEX] var mesh_tex_uv: PackedVector2Array = ary_surface[ArrayMesh.ARRAY_TEX_UV] var mesh_index: PackedInt32Array = ary_surface[ArrayMesh.ARRAY_INDEX] get_meshes is an experimental function added in v0.1. Please note that the specification may change or be deleted in the future. Dictionary get_motions() Returns a list of Motions from the currently held Live2D model. The returned Dictionary is group and the number of motions contained in it. To enumerate all motions, write as follows. var dict_motion = $GDCubismUserModel.get_motions() for group in dict_motion.keys(): for no in dict_motion[group]: print(\"group: %s, no: %d\" % [group, no]) Array get_parameter() Gets a class to operate the currently held Live2D model. Array get_part_opacity() Gets a class to operate the part transparency of the currently held Live2D model. void start_expression(expression_id: String) Plays the specified expression_id. GDCubismMotionQueueEntryHandle start_motion(group: String, no: int, priority: Priority) Plays the Motion specified by group and no. GDCubismMotionQueueEntryHandle start_motion_loop(group: String, no: int, priority: Priority) Plays the Motion specified by group and no. Specify this when you want to play repeatedly. If the loop argument is false, it behaves the same as the start_motion function. void stop_expression() Stops the currently playing Expression. void stop_motion() Stops the currently playing Motion.","title":"GDCubismUserModel","component":"gd_cubism","version":"0.6-antora","name":"gd_cubism_user_model","url":"/gd_cubism/0.6-antora/en/api/gd_cubism_user_model.html","titles":[{"text":"Desc","hash":"_desc","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Methods","hash":"_methods","id":3},{"text":"Signals","hash":"_signals","id":4},{"text":"Enumerations","hash":"_enumerations","id":5},{"text":"Property Descriptions","hash":"_property_descriptions","id":6},{"text":"Method Descriptions","hash":"_method_descriptions","id":7}]},"31":{"id":31,"text":"Elements contained in the Array returned by the get_part_opacities function of GDCubismUserModel.
