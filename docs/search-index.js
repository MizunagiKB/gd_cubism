This bug occurs when using the Vulkan renderer in Forward+, mobile, and although some issues have been addressed, it has not been resolved in the macOS environment. To address this issue, we have made it possible to specify COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030 during scons execution. COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030=1 (default) Does not call the rendering process of the Live2D model when the Window is in non-display state. COUNTERMEASURES_90017_90030=0 Calls the rendering process of the Live2D model regardless of the display state of the Window. For details on the bug, please refer to the following issues: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/89651 https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/90017 https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/90030 GDCubism, which internally uses CubismNativeFramework, is designed to be able to play Live2D models created with Cubism Editor. However, differences may arise in drawing priority and motion. The Cubism SDK for Native’s documentation contains differences in operation with Cubism Editor and tips for data creation. The content of the document is mainly for Unity and Cubism SDK for Native, and there are places where it cannot be used as is, but please refer to it.

If you want to use the latest Framework or customize it for your own needs, you can do so by following these steps: pushd thirdparty git clone https://github.com/Live2D/CubismNativeFramework.git popd This build has priority over the Framework in CubismSdkForNative, so please delete it when it is no longer needed. The following items are required for building: VisualStudio Community, version 2019 or lator. Python 3.8+ SCons 3.0+ build system. There have been reports that using SCons 4.8 results in build failures. This issue lies with the Godot Engine and is expected to be resolved in future versions. https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94117 For now, please use SCons 4.7. # You can address this by specifying the version when installing scons. # If a version higher than 4.8 is installed, you can use this method to revert to 4.7. pip install scons==4.7 Installing Visual Studio caveats If installing Visual Studio, make sure to enable C++ in the list of workflows to install. If you’ve already made the mistake of installing Visual Studio without C++ support, run the installer again; it should present you a Modify button. Running the installer from Add/Remove Programs will only give you a Repair option, which won’t let you install C++ tools.

If an addons folder already exists, please copy the contents of the gd_cubism folder. The addons folder is a designated folder for storing programs that extend the Godot Engine, such as GDCubism. Describes how to import a Live2D model and view it in Sprite2D. Please arrange the nodes in the same way while referring to the figure below. Select GDCubismUserModel from the node list and press the file selection button to the right of the Assets item. A file selection dialog will appear, from which you can select any *.model3.json file. Once the Live2D model is loaded correctly, the preview screen displays the Live2D model. Then select the Sprite2D node to open the Texture item. When you select ''New ViewportTexture'' from the list, a dialog to select Viewport will appear, select GDCubismUserModel. The Live2D model is displayed in the Texture field. The Live2D model is also displayed at the Sprite2D position. If the model file name is in Japanese, it will not load properly, so overwriting the file name output by the Cubism Editor and the reference in *.model3.json will work properly. It is possible that the Ids for EyeBlink in *.model3.json is not specified. Please set it and re-export, or add ParamEyeLOpen and ParamEyeROpen to Ids. Mipmap has been enabled for shaders from version 0.5 onwards. If you wish to enable it, please re-import the texture being used in Live2D with Mipmap enabled. The effect of Mipmap is quite significant, however, depending on the image, it may appear blurry. Without Mipmap Application With Mipmap Application Live2D models utilize various files, which are internally processed by Live2D. Consequently, Godot Engine struggles to effectively package Live2D-related resources. To ensure proper packaging, navigate to the Resources section in the Export screen. Here, directly specify the resources you are using and the folder containing these resources. For detailed instructions, refer to the Resource options section in the official documentation on Exporting projects: https://docs.godotengine.org/ja/4.x/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html#resource-options The demo folder contains the following items as samples. To run any of the samples, you will need the Live2D model of Nijiiro Mao. This Live2D model can be downloaded from https://www.live2d.com. Please arrange the contents of the downloaded file as follows: (demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d) mao_pro_jp runtime expressions …​ map_pro_t02.4096 …​ motions …​ mao_pro_t02.cdi3.json mao_pro_t02.moc3 mao_pro_t02.model3.json mao_pro_t02.physics3.json mao_pro_t02.pose3.json mao_pro_t02.can3 mao_pro_t02.cmo3 If you want to try with your own model, please place the output referring to the above in demo/addons/gd_cubism/example/res/live2d.

This page is machine translated. GDCubism is developed with the aim of simplifying the playback of Live2D models on the Godot Engine. Since rendering is performed via SubViewport, displaying the model requires some effort, but once displayed, it can be easily checked from the Godot Editor. While it is easy to display, it is somewhat unclear how to achieve finer control. For example, if you want to play a motion while changing only some parameters. Such operations can be achieved using GDScript; however, at present, they can only be discovered by reading the source code. Therefore, I have compiled this document as a reference. When controlling a Live2D model with GDScript, you will control the array obtained by the get_parameter function of GDCubismUserModel, but it will not be reflected in the Live2D model if you set it without thinking. The reason is that even if you try to overwrite the parameters, the set motion will overwrite them. To set it correctly, it is better to know how GDCubism performs rendering, so I will explain how GDCubism renders the Live2D model. (If you are not interested in the technical background, please skip this section) GDCubismUserModel performs the following processes every frame. The general order is \"Load Settings\", \"Update Live2D Information\", and \"Rendering\". Load Settings Update motion parameters. Update expression parameters. Reflect parameters of GDCubismUserModel. Reflect opacities of GDCubismUserModel. Update Live2D Information Update physical parameters. Update pose. Update rendering information. Create Rendering Information Calculate the number of SubViewport and Mesh required for rendering. Generate SubViewport and ArrayMesh and assign them to the node tree. In the actual program code (as of version 0.6), it is called as follows with _process as the trigger. _process is when playback_process_mode is set to IDLE. For PHYSICS, it is _physics_process, and for MANUAL, it is _advance. GDCubismUserModel._process GDCubismUserModel._update InternalCubismModel.pro_update InternalCubismModel.effect_batch Call of cubism_prologue signal Restore parameter information of Live2D model _motionManager.UpdateMotion Save parameter information of Live2D model _expressionManager.UpdateMotion InternalCubismModel.GetModelOpacity InternalCubismModel.efx_update If there is a change in the GDCubismEffect* node, call the efx_term, efx_init signal[1] InternalCubismModel.effect_batch Call of cubism_process signal Setting and getting parameter information Setting and getting opacity InternalCubismModel.epi_update Update physical parameters of Live2D model Update pose of Live2D model Update internal state of Live2D model InternalCubismModel.effect_batch Call of cubism_epilogue signal InternalCubismModel.update_node InternalCubismModel.GetRenderer Reflect rendering size Reflect rendering position Secure resources required for rendering Set information required for rendering to GodotEngine From here, we will describe how to proceed with the actual processing. The series of processes mentioned above are all performed when Godot Engine calls the _process of GDCubismUserModel. Therefore, if you want to change the parameters of the Live2D model a little, you can do it afterwards. The point to note is when Godot Engine calls the _process inside GDCubismUserModel. This depends on where GDCubismUserModel is in the node tree and where the script is set. To ensure it is reflected, set the playback_process_mode of GDCubismUserModel to MANUAL and call the advance function before operating the parameters. This prevents the parameter update from being overwritten before it is reflected. extends Node2D var param_valid: bool = false var l_eye: GDCubismParameter var r_eye: GDCubismParameter func _ready(): pass func _process(delta): var model: GDCubismUserModel = $Sprite2D/GDCubismUserModel for _o in model.get_parameters(): var o: GDCubismParameter = _o if o.id == \"ParamEyeLOpen\": o.value = 0.0 if o.id == \"ParamEyeROpen\": o.value = 0.0 If you add GDCubismEffectCustom as a child element of GDCubismUserModel, you will be able to receive the cubism_prologue, cubism_process, and cubism_epilogue signals. There are five types of signals that GDCubismEffectCustom can receive, but the ones related to the Live2D model are the following three. cubism_prologue Called before the motion and expression applied to the Live2D model are updated. Even if you change the parameters when receiving this signal, they will be ignored. Currently, you can operate on the parameters obtained by the get_parameters function of GDCubismUserModel, but the behavior may change in future versions. cubism_process Called after the motion and expression applied to the Live2D model are updated. If you update the parameters when receiving this signal, you can overwrite arbitrary processing while playing the motion. For example, replacing the shape of the hand, removing the hat, or closing the eyes. cubism_epilogue It is almost the same as cubism_process, but the content of get_parameters of GDCubismUserModel reflects the motion and expression. extends Node2D var param_valid: bool = false var l_eye: GDCubismParameter var r_eye: GDCubismParameter func _ready(): pass func _process(delta): pass func _on_gd_cubism_effect_custom_cubism_init(model: GDCubismUserModel): for _o in model.get_parameters(): var o: GDCubismParameter = _o if o.id == \"ParamEyeLOpen\": l_eye = o if o.id == \"ParamEyeROpen\": r_eye = o param_valid = true func _on_gd_cubism_effect_custom_cubism_term(model): param_valid = false func _on_gd_cubism_effect_custom_cubism_prologue(model, delta): pass func _on_gd_cubism_effect_custom_cubism_process(model: GDCubismUserModel, delta: float): if param_valid == true: l_eye.value = 0.0 r_eye.value = 0.0 func _on_gd_cubism_effect_custom_cubism_epilogue(model, delta): pass The following samples are provided using GDCubismEffectCustom.

Vector2 adjust_position [default: Vector2(0, 0)] Changes the rendering position of the Live2D model. GDCubism performs the rendering of the Live2D model within its own SubViewport. By adjusting this parameter, you can close-up a part of the Live2D model or use it when the auto_scale rendered result is not drawn well. float adjust_scale [default: 1.0] Changes the rendering size of the Live2D model. GDCubism performs the rendering of the Live2D model within its own SubViewport. By adjusting this parameter, you can freely change the rendering size of the Live2D model. String assets [default: \"\"] By specifying a file with the *.model3.json extension, you can load the Live2D model. As soon as you specify a file, it will be loaded immediately. Since the clear function is called internally, if you want to switch the Live2D model, you can do so by simply specifying a new file. bool auto_scale [default: true] GDCubismUserModel tries to render the Live2D model to fit within the SubViewport size specified for itself. Therefore, there may be results that the creator of the Live2D model did not intend. By unchecking this, you can display without scaling. bool load_expressions [default: true] If set to false, it will not load Expressions when loading the Live2D Model. bool load_motions [default: true] If set to false, it will not load Motions when loading the Live2D Model. Vector2i mask_viewport_size [default: Vector2i(0, 0)] Specify the resolution for the mask image required for the Live2D model. If either x or y is set to 0, the same size as the Viewport set in GDCubismUserModel will be used. Reducing the resolution can help conserve GPU memory. However, if the size is reduced to less than approximately 512x512, there may be issues with rendering quality depending on where the mask is applied. Ensure that the aspect ratio of this image matches the aspect ratio of the Viewport in GDCubismUserModel. For example, if it is 1024x512, then values like 512x256 or 128x64 are appropriate. Since GDCubism assumes the same aspect ratio as the Viewport for rendering, using an incorrect ratio may result in undesirable outcomes.

上で Live2D モデルを再生する事を簡単に目的に開発されています。 SubViewport経由で描画を行なっているため、モデル表示までは少し手間ですが、一旦表示まで行えば Godot Editor 上から簡単に確認できる様にしています。 簡単に表示が行える一方で、より細かい制御を行いたい場合にどうすれば良いのかというのがややわかりづらいものになっています。例えば、モーションの再生をさせつつ一部のパラメータのみを変更したいといった場合です。 その様な操作は GDScript を使用する事で実現できるのですが、現状ソースコードを読む事でしか気がつけません。 そのため、資料としてこのドキュメントを執筆しました。 GDScript で Live2D モデルを制御する場合、 GDCubismUserModel の get_parameter 関数で取得する配列を制御することになりますが、何も考えずに設定しても Live2D モデルにうまく反映されません。 その理由はパラメータを上書きしようとしても、設定されているモーションが上書きをしてしまう事が原因です。 うまく設定するには GDCubism がどの様に描画をおこなっているかを知るっておく方が良いかと思いますので、まずは GDCubism がどのように Live2D モデルを描画しているかについて説明します。（技術的な背景に興味がない方は読み飛ばしてください） GDCubismUserModel は以下の処理を毎フレーム行います。順番の大枠は「設定値の読込」「Live2D情報の更新」「描画」となります。 設定値の読込 モーションパラメータを更新。 エクスプレッションパラメータを更新。 GDCubismUserModel の parameters を反映。 GDCubismUserModel の opacities を反映。 Live2D情報の更新 物理パラメータを更新。 ポーズを更新。 描画情報を更新。 描画情報の作成 描画に必要な SubViewport と Mesh 数を計算。 SubViewport と ArrayMesh を生成し、ノードツリーに割り当て。 実際のプログラムコード（0.6時点）では、 _process をトリガとして以下の様に呼び出されています。 _process は playback_process_mode が IDLE に設定されている場合です。 PHYSICS の場合は _physics_process、 MANUAL の場合は _advance となります。 GDCubismUserModel._process GDCubismUserModel._update InternalCubismModel.pro_update InternalCubismModel.effect_batch cubism_prologue シグナルの呼び出し Live2D モデルのパラメータ情報を復元 _motionManager.UpdateMotion Live2D モデルのパラメータ情報を保存 _expressionManager.UpdateMotion InternalCubismModel.GetModelOpacity InternalCubismModel.efx_update GDCubismEffect*ノードに変更があれば、 efx_term, efx_init シグナルの呼び出し[1] InternalCubismModel.effect_batch cubism_process シグナルの呼び出し パラメータ情報の設定と取得 透明度の設定と取得 InternalCubismModel.epi_update Live2D モデルの物理パラメータを更新 Live2D モデルのポーズを更新 Live2D モデルの内部状態を更新 InternalCubismModel.effect_batch cubism_epilogue シグナルの呼び出し InternalCubismModel.update_node InternalCubismModel.GetRenderer 描画サイズの反映 描画位置の反映 描画に必要なリソースの確保 描画に必要な情報を GodotEngine に設定 ここからは実際にどう処理すれば良いかについて記述していきます。 前述した一連の処理は、すべて Godot Engine が GDCubismUserModel の _process を呼び出すタイミングで行われます。 そのため、少しだけ Live2D モデルのパラメータを変更したい場合は、その後で行えばよいことになります。注意点としては Godot Engine 側が GDCubismUserModel 内の _process が呼び出されるのがいつなのかという事です。 これは GDCubismUserModel がノードツリーのどの場所にあり、スクリプトがどこに設定されているかによります。確実に反映させるには、 GDCubismUserModel の playback_process_mode を MANUAL にして、 advance 関数を呼び出してからパラメータを操作するようにしてください。 これにより、パラメータの更新が反映前に上書きされてしまうのを防ぐ事が出来ます。 extends Node2D var param_valid: bool = false var l_eye: GDCubismParameter var r_eye: GDCubismParameter func _ready(): pass func _process(delta): var model: GDCubismUserModel = $Sprite2D/GDCubismUserModel for _o in model.get_parameters(): var o: GDCubismParameter = _o if o.id == \"ParamEyeLOpen\": o.value = 0.0 if o.id == \"ParamEyeROpen\": o.value = 0.0 GDCubismUserModel の子要素に GDCubismEffectCustom を追加すると、cubism_prologue, cubism_process, cubism_epilogue シグナルが受け取れるようになります。 GDCubismEffectCustom が受け取る事ができるシグナルは5種類ありますが、そのうち Live2D モデルに関するものは以下の3種類となります。 cubism_prologue Live2Dモデルに適用されたモーションとエクスプレッションの更新前に呼び出されます。このシグナルを受けった際にパラメータ変更を行なっても無視されてしまいます。 現在は GDCubismUserModel の get_parameters 関数で取得したパラメータに対して操作出来てしまいますが、将来のバージョンで挙動が変わる可能性があります。 cubism_process Live2Dモデルに適用されたモーションとエクスプレッションが更新された後に呼び出されます。このシグナルを受け取ったタイミングでパラメータを更新すると、モーションを再生させながら任意の処理を上書き出来ます。 例えば、手の形を差し替える、帽子を外す、目を閉じるといった処理です。 cubism_epilogue cubism_process とほとんど同じですが、GDCubismUserModel の get_parameters の内容がモーションとエクスプレッションを反映させた状態になっています。 extends Node2D var param_valid: bool = false var

If you want to move the eyes to the position where you drag the mouse pointer on the screen, use the following code to update the current position to GDCubismEffectTargetPoint. func _input(event): if event as InputEventMouseButton: pressed = event.is_pressed() if event as InputEventMouseMotion: if pressed == true: # Convert to Node using mouse coordinates for display var local_pos = $Sprite2D.to_local(event.position) # Adjust the converted coordinates to the display size of SubViewport var render_size: Vector2 = Vector2( float($Sprite2D/GDCubismUserModel.size.x) * $Sprite2D.scale.x, float($Sprite2D/GDCubismUserModel.size.y) * $Sprite2D.scale.y * -1.0 ) * 0.5 local_pos /= render_size $Sprite2D/GDCubismUserModel/GDCubismEffectTargetPoint.set_target(local_pos) else: $Sprite2D/GDCubismUserModel/GDCubismEffectTargetPoint.set_target(Vector2.ZERO) String body_angle_x [default: \"ParamBodyAngleX\"] float body_range [default: 10.0] String eyes_ball_x [default: \"ParamEyeBallX\"] String eyes_ball_y [default: \"ParamEyeBallX\"] float eyes_range [default: 1.0] String head_angle_x [default: \"ParamAngleX\"] String head_angle_y [default: \"ParamAngleY\"] String head_angle_z [default: \"ParamAngleZ\"] float head_range [default: 30.0] Vector2 get_target() void set_target(target: Vector2) String body_angle_x [default: \"ParamBodyAngleX\"] Specifies the ID used to change the orientation of the body with set_target. String body_range [default: 10.0] Specifies how much to move the ID specified with body_angle_x. The larger the value, the more sensitive the response, and if you specify 0.0, it will not respond. String eyes_ball_x [default: \"ParamEyeBallX\"] Specifies the ID used to change the line of sight (direction of the pupil) with set_target. String eyes_ball_y [default: \"ParamEyeBallX\"] Specifies the ID used to change the line of sight (direction of the pupil) with set_target. String eyes_range [default: 1.0] Specifies how much to move the ID specified with eyes_ball_x, eyes_ball_x. The larger the value, the more sensitive the response, and if you specify 0.0, it will not respond. String head_angle_x [default: \"ParamHeadAngleX\"] Specifies the ID used to change the line of sight (direction of the pupil) with set_target. String head_angle_y [default: \"ParamHeadAngleY\"] Specifies the ID used to change the line of sight (direction of the pupil) with set_target. String head_angle_z [default: \"ParamHeadAngleZ\"] Specifies the ID used to change the line of sight (direction of the pupil) with set_target. String head_range [default: 3.0] Specifies how much to move the ID specified with head_angle_x, head_angle_y, head_angle_z. The larger the value, the more sensitive it responds, and if you specify 0.0, it will not respond. Vector2 get_target() Gets the direction the Live2D model is facing. void set_target(target: Vector2) Sets the direction the Live2D model is facing. The direction that can be set is in the range of -1.0 to 1.0 for both x and y. If you pass a value that exceeds the range, it will be contained within the range. The coordinates to specify are not the coordinates of the screen, but the range from the center of the Node where the texture is pasted. x: 0.0, y: 0.0 Front x: -1.0, y: 0.0 Screen left x: 1.0, y: 0.0 Screen right x: 0.0, y: -1.0 Screen bottom x: 0.0, y: 1.0 Screen top","title":"GDCubismEffectTargetPoint","component":"gd_cubism","version":"0.6","name":"gd_cubism_effect_target_point","url":"/gd_cubism/0.6/en/api/gd_cubism_effect_target_point.html","titles":[{"text":"Desc","hash":"_desc","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Methods","hash":"_methods","id":3},{"text":"Signals","hash":"_signals","id":4},{"text":"Enumerations","hash":"_enumerations","id":5},{"text":"Constants","hash":"_constants","id":6},{"text":"Property Descriptions","hash":"_property_descriptions","id":7},{"text":"Method Descriptions","hash":"_method_descriptions","id":8}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"GDCubismUserModel の子要素として配置することで、瞬きアニメーションを行います。","title":"GDCubismEffectEyeBlink","component":"gd_cubism","version":"0.6","name":"gd_cubism_effect_eye_blink","url":"/gd_cubism/0.6/ja/api/gd_cubism_effect_eye_blink.html","titles":[{"text":"Desc","hash":"_desc","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Methods","hash":"_methods","id":3},{"text":"Signals","hash":"_signals","id":4},{"text":"Enumerations","hash":"_enumerations","id":5},{"text":"Constants","hash":"_constants","id":6},{"text":"Property Descriptions","hash":"_property_descriptions","id":7},{"text":"Method Descriptions","hash":"_method_descriptions","id":8}]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"The return values of the start_motion function and the start_random_motion function of GDCubismUserModel.
